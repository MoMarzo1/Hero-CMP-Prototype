## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/hero-portal-prototype.git
cd hero-portal-prototype
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Application

### Development Mode

To start the application in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will open automatically in your default browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Production Build

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `build/` directory.

To serve the production build locally:

```bash
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

## Project Structure

```
hero-portal-prototype/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/              # Public assets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HeroPortalDashboard.jsx  # Main application component
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.js          # App entry point
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js        # React DOM rendering
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.css       # Global styles
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json        # Project dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tailwind.config.js  # Tailwind CSS configuration
```

## Technologies Used

- **React** - UI framework
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Lucide React** - Icon library
- **Create React App** - Build tooling

## Key Components

### Navigation
- Collapsible sidebar with organized sections
- Breadcrumb navigation
- User profile management

### Security Features
- Comprehensive vulnerability tracking
- Security scoring system
- Integration with industry-standard security tools
- OWASP Top 10 compliance tracking

### Financial Management
- Real-time budget tracking
- Cost anomaly detection
- Multi-project financial overview
- Export capabilities for reports

### AI Assistant
- HeroAI chatbot for platform assistance
- Context-aware help system
- Quick action suggestions

## Development Tips

### Modifying Components
The entire application is contained in `src/HeroPortalDashboard.jsx` for prototype simplicity. In a production environment, this should be split into separate component files.

### Adding New Features
1. Add navigation items in the `Sidebar` component
2. Create new page components following the existing pattern
3. Add cases to the `renderPage()` switch statement
4. Update the URL mapping in `getPageUrl()`

### Styling
The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Modify `tailwind.config.js` to customize the design system.

## Mock Data
The prototype uses mock data for demonstrations. In production, these would be replaced with API calls to backend services.

## Browser Support
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 3000 is already in use:
```bash
PORT=3001 npm start
```

### Dependencies Issues
Clear npm cache and reinstall:
```bash
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
